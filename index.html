        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Gabriel Gonzales. I must say, creating my own website has been quite a journey. As a passionate tech enthusiast, I’ve enjoyed the challenge. In addition to my love for technology, I’m also a big sports fan, with a particular fondness for football, or as some might call it, soccer. I hope you enjoy exploring my site! </p>
